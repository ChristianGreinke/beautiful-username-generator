```

You can also clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChristianGreinke/beautiful-username-generator.git
```

## Usage

Below is an example demonstrating how to use the username generator in your Node.js application:

```javascript
const generator = require('beautiful-username-generator');
//const {gen} = require('beautiful-username-generator');

(async () => {
    try {
        const username = await generator.gen({ maxLength: 40 });
        //const username = await gen({ maxLength: 20 });
        console.log('Generated Username:', username);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error generating username:', error);
    }
})();
```

### Options

The `gen` function accepts an optional object where you can set the maximum length for the username.

| Option      | Type   | Description                                      | Default Value         |
|-------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| `maxLength` | Number | Maximum length of the generated username.         | Sum of attribute, color, and flower lengths (52 chars) |
| `maxTries` | Number | Maximum tries to generate username below maxLength.         | 1000 |

## API

### `generator.gen([options])`

- **Description**: Generates a random username like VibrantVioletOrchid.
- **Parameters**:
  - `options` (optional): An object to customize the username generation process. Currently, it supports:
    - `maxLength`: Limits the length of the generated username. Note that setting a shorter maximum length will reduce the variety and uniqueness of generated usernames, as fewer character combinations will be possible, leading to lower entropy.
    - `maxTries`: Limits amount of tries to find a username short enough. To low maxTries and low maxLength might fail to produce a username.
- **Returns**: A `Promise` that resolves to a string, which is the generated username.

## How It Works

The username generator works by selecting random elements from three predefined binary files:
1. **Attributes**: Contains 208 unique attributes.
2. **Colors**: Contains 219 unique color names.
3. **Flowers**: Contains 402 unique flower names.

The generator picks random entries from these binary files, decodes them, and combines them to form a unique and beautiful username. Each username consists of three parts:
- A random attribute
- A random color
- A random flower

This structure ensures that usernames are both visually appealing and memorable.

## Security Advice

While the `beautiful-username-generator` can generate millions of unique usernames, it is important to note that **usernames alone should not be relied upon for security purposes**. A username generated by this library should be used in combination with a strong, random password to ensure adequate security. 

This approach is similar to the security of using email addresses or handpicked usernames, where the username alone is not the main factor in security but instead the strength of the password is critical.

## File Structure

- **`api/generator.js`**: Main logic for the username generation.
- **`api/flattenedAttributes_15.bin`**: Binary file storing random attributes.
- **`api/flattenedColors_15.bin`**: Binary file storing random color names.
- **`api/flattenedFlowers_22.bin`**: Binary file storing random flower names.

The generator pulls data from these binary files to construct usernames dynamically.
